### <a id="easy1"></a>1. Histogram of Tweets [Twitter SQL Interview]
Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

`tweets` **Table**:
| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| tweet_id    | integer |
| user_id   | integer |
| msg | string |
| tweet_date | timestamp |


`tweets` **Example Input**:
| twwet_id | user_id | msg  | tweet_date |
| ---- | ----| ------------------------- | ---------- |
|214252|	111	|Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.|	12/30/2021 00:00:00|
|739252|	111	|Despite the constant negative press covfefe|	01/01/2022 00:00:00|
|846402|	111	|Following @NickSinghTech on Twitter changed my life!|	02/14/2022 00:00:00|
|241425|	254	|If the salary is so competitive why wonâ€™t you tell me what it is?|	03/01/2022 00:00:00|
|231574|	148	|I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed|	03/23/2022 00:00:00|

`tweets` **Table**:
| twwet_bucket |  users_num |
| -------| ------- |
|   1  |   2   |
|   2  |   1   |

**Explanation**:
Based on the example output, there are two users who posted only one tweet in 2022, and one user who posted two tweets in 2022. The query groups the users by the number of tweets they posted and displays the number of users in each group.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

### <a id="easy2"></a>2. Data Science Skills [Linkedin SQL Interview]
Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

**Assumption:**

`* There are no duplicates in the candidates table.`

`candidates` **Table**:
| Column Name | Type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| candidate_id | integer |
| skill | varchar |

`candidates` **Example Input**:
| candidate_id | skill    |
| ----------- | --------- |
|123|	Python |
|123|	Tableau |
|123|	PostgreSQL |
|234|	R |
|234|	PowerBI |
|234|	SQL Server |
|345|	Python |
|345|	Tableau |

`candidates` **Example Output**:
| candidate_id |
| ----------- | 
| 123 |

**Expalanation:**
Candidate 123 is displayed because they have Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL skills. 345 isn't included in the output because they're missing one of the required skills: PostgreSQL.

### <a id="easy4"></a>4. Unfinished Parts [Tesla SQL Interview Question]
Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions:

* parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
* An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.

This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.

Effective April 11th 2023, the problem statement and assumptions were updated to enhance clarity.

`part_assembly` **Table**:
|Column Name|	Type |
|-----------|--------|
|part|	string |
|finish_date|	datetime |
|assembly_step|	integer |

`part_assembly` **Example Input**:
|part|	finish_date	|assembly_step|
|-------| ------------------- | ---- |
|battery|	01/22/2022 00:00:00 |	1 |
|battery|	02/22/2022 00:00:00| 2 |
|battery|	03/22/2022 00:00:00|	3 |
|bumper|	01/22/2022 00:00:00 |	1 |
|bumper|	02/22/2022 00:00:00 |	2 |
|bumper|		| 3 | 
|bumper|		| 4 |

**Example Input**:
| part |	assembly_step |
| -----| ---------------|
|bumper|	3 |
|bumper|	4 |

**Explanation**
The bumpers in step 3 and 4 are the only item that remains unfinished as it lacks a recorded finish date.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
